FinBIF aggregates Finnish biodiversity data from multiple sources in a single open access portal for researchers, citizen scientists, industry and government.

Online database: Finnish biodiversity data from multiple sources.

Occurence data available.

Note: to me taxonomy in this package is a very minor component.

Use in example: YES.
