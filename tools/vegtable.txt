The aim of vegtable is to provide a way for handling databases stored in Turboveg. This package incorporates many concepts and some functions included in the package vegdata but defining an homonymous S4 class containing all elements of a database in just one object. The package vegtable also contains several methods for this object class.

Species lists in vegtable objects are handled by the package taxlist, thus I will recommend to take a look on it.

This package has been developed as a tool handling data stored in SWEA-Dataveg. Further development is running in the context of the project GlobE-wetlands.
